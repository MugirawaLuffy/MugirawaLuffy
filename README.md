# Projects I currently work on
There are a lot of projects I work on privatly, and you can have a look on your own, go through the READMEs or look at the source code. Here I just quickly want to show-off my dearest projects that get most attention by me.

## Gear5th

A small "Game engine" like project, which's 3d rendering an scripting capabilities I will use in order to quickly build impressive graphical applications for university projects and stuff alike. The ground concept is derived by the Cherrno's Game engine series but a lot of functionality (Graphing, scripting with my own programming language Santuryu and more) makes Gear5th unlike any other different Game Engine

## Santuryu

Santuryu itself is a Compiler used to compile .ryu files down into C# IL (Intermediate language). For more specifics on the language read the README.md on the Santuryu page.
Being compiled down into C# IL, this means that I can implement native scripting C# into Gear5th Game Engine, and automatically be able to use RYU code to write scripts in Gear5th with little effort. That also is the main goal for Santuryu and it's main purpose, but Santuryus language is easy to use and learn and getting more effective the more inbuilt functions I add, which makes it a "good" language to use in general purposes

# One Piece
Yes, my projects are named after techniques from characters in OnePiece. I love this show and I'm bad at finding names for my projects so that's what I ended up with.
